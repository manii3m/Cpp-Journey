# 📚 C++ Journey - From Basics to Advanced DSA

Welcome to my C++ learning journey! This repository documents my progressive learning path through C++, starting from fundamental concepts to advanced Data Structures and Algorithms.

## 🎯 Learning Path

### Phase 1: Fundamentals
- **1st Concept** - Introduction to C++ basics
  - Hello World program
  - Basic output with `cout`
  - Introduction to variables and basic arithmetic

- **Variable & Constant** - Understanding data storage
  - Variable declaration and initialization
  - Constants and their importance
  - Naming conventions and best practices
  - Scope and lifetime of variables

- **Data Types** - Foundation of C++ programming
  - Primitive data types (`int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `bool`)
  - Type casting and conversions
  - Size of different data types
  - Signed vs unsigned types

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- G++ compiler installed
- VS Code or any C++ IDE
- Basic understanding of programming concepts

### Compilation & Execution

Using the VS Code build task (Ctrl+Shift+B):
```bash
# Automatically builds the active file
```

Or manually from terminal:
```bash
# Compile
g++ -o output_name source_file.cpp

# Run
./output_name
```

## 📝 Current Topics Covered

| Topic | File | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| Basic Output & Variables | `1st Concept.cpp` | ✅ Complete |
| Variables & Constants | `Variable & Constant.cpp` | ✅ Complete |
| Data Types | `data_type.cpp` | ✅ Complete |

## 🎓 What I'm Learning

### Completed
- ✅ Syntax and structure of C++
- ✅ Variables and constants
- ✅ Primitive data types
- ✅ Basic I/O operations

### In Progress
- 🔄 Operators and expressions
- 🔄 Control flow (if/else, loops)
- 🔄 Functions

### Coming Soon
- 📋 Arrays and Strings
- 📋 Pointers and References
- 📋 Objects and Classes
- 📋 Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues)
- 📋 Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming)

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Data Types in C++
```cpp
int number = 42;              // Whole numbers
float decimal = 3.14f;        // ~7 decimal places
double precise = 2.71828;     // ~15 decimal places
char letter = 'A';            // Single character
bool flag = true;             // true/false
```

### Variables vs Constants
```cpp
int myVar = 10;               // Variable - can change
const int CONSTANT = 5;       // Constant - cannot change
```

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

- **Language**: C++ (C++11 and above)
- **Compiler**: G++
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS (Dev Container)

## 📈 Progress Tracker

- **Start Date**: 2024
- **Current Level**: Beginner (Basics)
- **Target Level**: Advanced DSA
